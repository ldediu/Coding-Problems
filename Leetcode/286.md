# 286. Walls and Gates

## Description

```
You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

-1 - A wall or an obstacle.
0 - A gate.
INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.

Example: 

Given the 2D grid:

INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF

After running your function, the 2D grid should be:

  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4
```

## Solution

```JavaScript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} rooms
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify rooms in-place instead.
 */

var wallsAndGates = function(rooms) {
    let q = [];
    let dirs = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]];
    for (let i = 0; i < rooms.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < rooms[i].length; j++) {
            if (rooms[i][j] == 0)
                q.push([i, j]);
        }
    }
    while (q.length) {
        let curr = q.shift();
        for (let dir of dirs) {
            let y = curr[0] + dir[0];
            let x = curr[1] + dir[1];
            if (y < 0 || x < 0 || y >= rooms.length || x >= rooms[0].length
                || rooms[y][x] == -1 || rooms[y][x] != 2147483647)
                continue;
            rooms[y][x] = rooms[curr[0]][curr[1]] + 1;
            q.push([y, x]);            
        }
    }
};
```
