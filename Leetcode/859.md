# 859. Buddy Strings

## Description

```
Given two strings A and B of lowercase letters, return true if you can swap two letters in A so the result is equal to B, otherwise, return false.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at A[i] and A[j]. For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

Example 1:

Input: A = "ab", B = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to B.

Example 2:

Input: A = "ab", B = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != B.

Example 3:

Input: A = "aa", B = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to B.

Example 4:

Input: A = "aaaaaaabc", B = "aaaaaaacb"
Output: true

Example 5:

Input: A = "", B = "aa"
Output: false
```

## Solution

```JavaScript
/**
 * @param {string} A
 * @param {string} B
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var buddyStrings = function(A, B) {
    if (A.length !== B.length)
        return false;
    let diff = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
        if (A[i] != B[i])
            diff.push(i);
    }
    if (diff.length > 2) return false;
    if (!diff.length) {
        return (A.length != [...new Set(A)].length);
    }
    console.log(diff)
    return (A[diff[0]] == B[diff[1]] && A[diff[1]] == B[diff[0]]);
};
```
